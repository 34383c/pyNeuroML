## pyNeuroML


**Under development: subject to change without notice...**

### Some planned features

#### Single Python package for NeuroML2/LEMS

One Python package which can be installed using pip & a user has everything they need to work with NeuroML2/LEMS files:

- libNeuroML
- PyLEMS
- A bundled version of jNeuroML which can be used to run simulations

#### Run models using jNeuroML or PyLEMS

Ability to run NeuroML2/LEMS models using jLEMS/jNeuroML or PyLEMS

- Uses the same command line interface as jNeuroML?

#### Access to export & import options of jNeuroML

All export & import options of jNeuroML available through easy command line interface

- pynml

#### Helper Python scripts

Lots of helper scripts for commonly used NeuroML2 functions

- nml2analyse: channels, etc.

#### Home for existing functionality distributed in various places

Incorporate ChannelML2NeuroML2beta.xsl for updating ChannelML

#### NEURON to NeuroML2

Scripts for converting NEURON to NeuroML2
	
- Export morphologies plus channels
- mod files - make best guess at initial NeuroML2 form
	
#### View cells in 3D?

Built in viewer of cells in 3D? Mayavi?

#### PyNN?

More closely tied to PyNN?
